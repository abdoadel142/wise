# wise

wise is a mobile application that can be used as a communication between expert persons and inexpert persons. The application is used to transfer practices, information, knowledge, experience between users. 

## Getting Started
Opinions are like noses, everyone’s got one. Experiences on the other hand are highly valuable. In every culture elders hold positions of respect and honor. Their depth and wisdom make them a valuable asset, because they provide guidance and leadership. And their value is not based on their judgements or opinions, it’s based on their experiences.
Instead of asking people for advice or suggestions, ask for their experiences. If you’re facing a challenge, seek out people who may have related experiences and ask them:
	Have you ever encountered a similar situation?
	What did you do?
	What worked?
	What would you do differently?
	What did you learn from this experience?
